set and play a system of objects with gravity connection

gravitation of law f = k(g)*m1*m2/r^2
k(g) - gravitational constant

gravity not a force but a curvature(shape) of the space
more mass - more curvature

--------------------------------------------------------
tech: canvas, button
-canvas with handling the position of touching(clicking) and the time of touching
*for creating an object with the position and the size(time)
-button switch: start/stop animation
*need setInterval
