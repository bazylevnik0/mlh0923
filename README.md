<h1>System of Objects with Gravity Connection</h1>
This project is a simulation of a system of objects with gravitational connections using HTML canvas and JavaScript. It allows you to create objects that interact with each other based on the gravitational force between them.

<h2>Gravitational Force</h2>
The gravitational force between two objects is calculated using the formula:
<br>
<code>f = k * (g) * m1 * m2 / r^2</code><br>
where:<br>
<code>f is the gravitational force
k(g) is the gravitational constant
m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects
r is the distance between the centers of the objects
In this simulation, the gravitational constant k(g) is used to control the strength of the gravitational force.
</code><br>
<h2>System Structure</h2>
The system is implemented using an array to store the objects and a class to represent each object. Each object has properties such as position (x and y) and size (size).
<br><br>
The simulation is managed by a time object that provides the following functions:

<b>recall:</b> This function calculates the new positions of the objects based on the gravitational forces acting on them. The algorithm for calculating the shifts is not specified in detail but involves sorting the objects by size and iterating through them to update their positions.<br>
<b>startAnimation:</b> This function starts the animation by continuously recalculating and updating the object positions at regular intervals using setInterval.<br>
<b>pauseAnimation:</b> This function pauses the animation by stopping the interval updates.<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
To use the simulation, interact with the canvas by clicking to create objects. The position and size of the objects are determined by the position and duration of the click. Use the start/stop button to control the animation of the objects.

<h2>Note</h2>
This simulation does not take into account acceleration and assumes that each object only calculates the force and moves every second. In reality, the speed should increase as objects get closer to each other.
<br>
Additionally, the simulation calculates forces only between neighboring objects based on their size. It does not consider interactions between all objects in the system. Calculating interactions between all elements can be a complex problem.

<h2>Postmortem</h2>
Please note that this project was developed within a span of three days with limited sleep. It is a simplified implementation and may not accurately represent all aspects of gravitational interactions.

Feel free to experiment with the simulation and make modifications based on your requirements.
